#Create the Reports Page


Go to Github.com and and open the same project where you created your Game Design Document.

Create a new page in your project's Wiki and name it *Reports*.

List each remaining week of development as a heading. Under each week's heading, add the following:

	1.  This week's plan
	(Milestone for the week)

	2.  Daily Review

	3.  Week Review
		Did you accomplish your goals for the week?  Why or why not?


#The Four L's

At the end of each day, write down your four L's. It doesn't have to be long, and you can write it in Japanese if it helps you express your thoughts better.

Liked - something you really liked

Learned - things you have learned

Lacked - things that you have been doing, but you think you could have done better

Longed for - something you desired or wished for

#Weekly Plan

At the beginning of each week, write down the plan for what you hope to accomplish. If it's different than your Game Design Document, then you should update the GDD!

At the end of the week, write your weekly review. What did you accomplish? Did you accomplish your goals for the week? Why or why not?
